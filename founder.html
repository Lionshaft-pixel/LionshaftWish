      <h2>Hey! I'm Lionshaft 👋</h2>
      <p>
        I'm a 14-year-old self-taught dev from India. I didn't grow up with luxury or high-end gear but my PC is made of
        second-hand parts, my monitor's 768p.

      <h2>Why I Created LionshaftWish 🌟</h2>
      <p>
        This isn't just a website, it's a platform where people can post real wishes and maybe... someone kind enough
        will help them. I started this with zero funds, just a heart full of hope and a dream of escaping my current
        environment.
      </p>
      <p>
        I want to go to a better place, grow my skills. This is more than a donation page. This is my way out, and maybe
        it becomes someone else's too.
      </p>

      <h2>My Tech Journey 💻</h2>
      <p>
        I taught myself HTML, CSS, and JavaScript using a cheap PC and pure curiosity. I built this platform and another
        site called PirateHub. I believe knowledge should be shared, and dreams shouldn't cost millions.

      <h2>My Promise 🤝</h2>
      <p>
        I will always be honest, transparent, and grateful. If you help me, you're not just supporting a website,
        you're fueling a dream that refuses to die.
